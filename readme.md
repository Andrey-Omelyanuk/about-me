**Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, PostgreSQL, HTML, Pug, CSS, Stylus, JavaScript, TypeScript, Webpack, Angular, Vue.js, JSData, RxJS, Cordova, Ansible**

### Team
    3-5 developers, 1 web-designer


### Responsibilities and Achievements
- led the team and the project
- interviewed software developers
- developed mobile (Android and iOS) version using Cordova 
- used PubNub for sending async messages to clients
- used Sentry to gather error logs from back-end and front-end
- built architecture of the application
- did everything that the project required except web design and things that I could delegate to other developers (usually I delegated UI tasks).

### More details
    I led the project. 
    The project was started with Angular 1 and with no data layer.
    When I joined, I split the project into two parts (back and front). 
    This has facilitated the work of front-end developers (they know nothing about back-end, they have only API now). 
    Also, we started to use js-data https://www.js-data.io/v2.9/docs/home for the data layer,
    Pug instead of pure HTML and Stylus instead of pure CSS.
    Later I tried to use TypeScript and I liked it and we migrated to TypeScript. It was very easy.
    After 2 year, I was disappointed with Angular 1 (terrible performance and I didn’t believe to Angular anymore)
    and we migrated to Vue.js (performance much better now! some tests showed boost up to x15).
    After Vue migration, I integrated MobX into js-data for reactivity.
    On the backend, I used Django + Django Rest Framework. 
    These tools helped me to build REST API very quickly and effectively.
    I integrated the PubNub service for async messages from the back-end to the front-end(web and mobile)
    and I used it for new messages in a chat and user notifications. 
    For long tasks that should be run in the background, I used Celery with RabbitMQ broker. 
    I had no performance issues on the backend, all queries to DB were optimized by me,
    all tables used correct indexes. Actually, it was not a big win because I had not a lot of data,
    production DB had a ~400MB size and grew not too fast (~30MB per month).
    I integrated Sentry to gather errors from users.
    I planned to split the monolith back-end into microservices (auth and message microservices) but I had no time to do it and left the project. 


## Nord-Soft   
http://nord-soft.com/

**Senior Full Stack Developer**  
Jan 2013 - May 2015 (2.4 years)

**Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, Git, Mercurial, Bootstrap**

### Team
    1-7 developers

### Responsibilities and Achievements
- developed a lot of small/middle web projects 
- leading projects from scratch to final
- development software architecture
- development front-end and back-end
- deploying projects on servers

### Interesting tasks that I remember
- Video montage.

    A web application that makes a video from pictures and soundtracks.
    I used Celery to run a background job and FFmpeg for making a video.

- Optimized DB query.

    It was a company that repairs airplanes.
    They had a web application for counting repairs. 
    It was a very unusual DB schema, they used PostgreSQL table inheritance and it made a problem for performance. 
    I made the query faster ~20% using indexes but it still was not acceptable.
    The last option was to remove table inheritance and required a lot of time to refactor.
    The customer did not agree to make the refactoring and bought a more powerful server.
